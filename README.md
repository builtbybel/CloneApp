## CloneApp is a free portable and simple backup tool which could save you a lot of time when migrating your software or reinstalling Windows.

There's nothing like a fresh install of Windows to clear your mind, but it comes at a cost: you have to set everything up again, just the way you like it.

You don't have to regularly reinstall Windows just to keep things clean, but that doesn't mean you'll never have to do it again. Maybe you just bought or built a new computer, or maybe you didn't take care of your computer as well as you thought and you have to do a clean install.

Maybe you just want to wipe the slate clean for that new, fresh feeling.

A clean slate is nice, but it also means you're going to spend the rest of the weekend setting up all your old programs, settings, and system tweaks, half of which you've probably forgotten because you set them up so long ago.

If you don’t want to do a full backup and restore, CloneApp backs up settings for the most popular Windows programs so you can restore them later.


#### CloneApp supports about 250 different Windows programs. The complete list can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mirinsoft/CloneApp/blob/master/docs/supported-apps.md)

#### CloneApp is closed source, but you can collaborate and contribute i.e., custom Plug-ins, localizations, report issues or maintain a documentation.
